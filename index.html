			    <h2>Vulkan, a new generation graphics API</h2>
				<p>
				Vulkan, is a known as a graphical API. It is generally used in game developement,
				game engines, interactive media and highly parallelized computing.
				</p>
				<p>The people who typically use Vulkan are developers and engineers.</p>
				<p>
				Vulkan is, i belive for a lack of word to be the most important APIs today. With the many
			    geopolitical and ecological crises, there is a need to create affordable and impactless componant for computer
				Vulkan helps meet this need by offering an excellent performance-to-cost ratio and backward compatibility, allowing the use of older components.

				<h2>What is Vulkan.</h2>
				<p>
				An <strong>API</strong> the acronym for <em>Application Programming Interface</em>, 
				you can describe it as a link between hardware and the software.
				it is not intended to be used directly by end users, but developers and engineers who use it to create software.
				</p>
				<p>
				Khronos Group began a project to create a next-generation graphics API in July 2014, with a kickoff meeting at Valve. 
				At SIGGRAPH 2014, the project was publicly announced with a call for participants.
				</p>
				<p>
				According to the US Patent and Trademark Office, the trademark for Vulkan was 
				filed on February 19, 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
				Vulkan was officially named and announced at Game Developers Conference in 
				2015, although speculation and rumors centered around a new API already existed and 
				referred to it as "<strong>glNext</strong>".

				<h2>Why should you use Vulkan?</h2>
				<p>
				Vulkan is a graphics API designed to provide the best performance and 
				greater control over the hardware compared to older APIs
				</p>
				<p>
				Vulkan allow developers to directly manage memory and the commands sent to the 
				GPU. This makes it possible to fully use the power of modern graphics cards.
				</p>
				<p>
				Another important advantage of Vulkan is its efficient multithreading support. 
				This means that the CPU can process multiple tasks at the same time, making
				applications faster and reducing stuttering, especially in video games.
				</p>
				<p>
				Vulkan is available on many platforms like Windows, Linux, macOS, Android 
				and others. This simplifies the developement of sofware compatible with 
				multiple systems.
				</p>

			<section id="how-Vulkan-work">
				<h2>How does Vulkan work?</h2>
				<p>
				To understand Vulkan, it is firstly necessary to understand the role of the CPU
			    and the GPU. The CPU to the calculations and the instruction, while the GPU 
				handles graphics rendering.
				</p>
				<p>
				In Vulkan, developers must create the command buffers. These are lists of
			    instructions sent to the GPU that specify exactly what should be displayed on
				the screen and how it should be done.
				</p>
				<p>
				Vulkan also uses graphics pipelines. A pipeline defines all the steps required
			    to render an image, such as vertex and pixel processing. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Memory management in Vulkan is explicit. This means that developer choose how
			    	GPU memory is used. This method is complex, but it can achive the best
				possible performance when used correctly.
				</p>

			<section id="Vulkan-area">
				<h2>Vulkan areas of use</h2>
				<p>
				Vulkan is mainly used in video games as it provides high levels of detail
				and smooth performance.
				</p>
				<p>
				Vulkan is also used in virtual reality where the performance is essential to avoid
			    any slowdowns or discomfort for the user.
				</p>
				<p>
				Vulkan is also used for simulations, for exemple in the industriy or scientific
			    research, as well as some professional graphical software 
				</p>

					<h2>The pros and cons of Vulkan</h2>
					<table>
				    		<tr>
							<th scope="col">Pros</th>
							<th scope="col">Cons</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
						    	<td>High performance</td>
							<td>Difficult to learn</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
					    		<td>Precise control over the GPU</td>
							<td>Requires a lot of code</td>

					    		<td>Compatible with many platforms</td>
							<td>Much more complex than OpenGL</td>

				<p>
				Vulkan is therefore very powerful, but requires a lot of work and knowledge
			    to be used correctly.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
				In conclusion, Vulkan is a modern graphics API designed to make full ise of a
			    graphics card's performance. It is particularly well suited for softwares 
				such as video games and virtual reality.
				</p>
				<p>
				Despite its complexity, Vulkan represents the future of graphics technologies. 
				It is increasingly used in the professional world and is an important skill 
				for careers related to IT and the video game industry.
